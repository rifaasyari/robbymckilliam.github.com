The algorithm is of complexity O(T), where T is the sequence length, and is therefore computationally superior to existing maximum-likelihood (ML) detectors of complexity O(T logT). Our detector is based on a new approximation we propose to the noncoherent ML function. We show that by using this close approximation, the detection problem reduces to a nearest lattice point problem for the lattice An*, from which we derive our O(T) approach. Simulation results are provided that show the difference in bit error rate is negligibly small for a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios.},

This includes $A_{n}$, $E_{7}$ , $E_{8}$ and their duals $A_{n}^{ast }$, $E_{7}^{ast }$, and $E_{8}^{ast }$. We consider the problem of finding a nearest point in a Coxeter lattice. We describe two new algorithms, one with worst case arithmetic complexity $O(nlog {n})$ and the other with worst case complexity $O(n)$ where $n$ is the dimension of the lattice. We show that for the particular lattices $A_{n}$ and $A_{n}^{ast }$ the algorithms are equivalent to nearest point algorithms that already exist in the literature. },

  abstract = { Single frequency estimation is a long-studied problem with application domains including radar, sonar, telecommunications, astronomy and medicine. One method of estimation, called phase unwrapping, attempts to estimate the frequency by performing linear regression on the phase of the received signal. This procedure is complicated by the fact that the received phase is `wrapped' modulo $2pi$ and therefore must be `unwrapped' before the regression can be performed. In this paper, we propose an estimator that performs phase unwrapping in the least squares sense. The estimator is shown to be strongly consistent and its asymptotic distribution is derived. We then show that the problem of computing the least squares phase unwrapping is related to a problem in algorithmic number theory known as the nearest lattice point problem. We derive a polynomial time algorithm that computes the least squares estimator. The results of various simulations are described for different values of sample size and SNR.},
