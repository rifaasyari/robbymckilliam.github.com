Welcome to Signals and Systems EEET3041 for 2014.  My name is <a href="../">Robby McKilliam</a> and I'll be your lecturer.  In this course we learn how to analyse linear-time invariant systems that are used to model and design electrical circuits, mechanical machines, and electro-mechanical devices.
</p>
<p>
I studied Engineering and Mathematics at the University of Queensland and completed my PhD there in 2010.  I've since worked at the <a href="http://www.itr.unisa.edu.au/">Institute for Telecommunications Research</a> at the Mawson Lakes Campus.  My research interests are primarily statistical signal processing and number theory.
</p>
<p>
Lecture notes and corresponding software will be added to this website as the course progresses.
